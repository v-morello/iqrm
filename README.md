A minimal implementation of the IQRM interference flagging algorithm for radio pulsar and transient searches. This module only provides the algorithm that infers a channel mask from some spectral statistic that measures the level of RFI contamination in a time-frequency data block. It should be useful as a reference implementation to developers who wish to integrate IQRM into an existing pipeline / search code.

**However, if you wish to clean existing SIGPROC files using IQRM, please use Kaustubh Rajwade's full implementation:**

## Installation

The easiest method is to use pip install, which also pulls required dependencies:
```
pip install iqrm
```

Alternatively you can clone the repository and run `make install`:
```
git clone https://github.com/v-morello/iqrm
cd iqrm
make install
```

This simply runs `pip install` in [editable mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/cli/pip_install/#editable-installs), which means you can freely edit the code. It also installs any required dependencies with pip that are not present already.

## Usage

The module provides a single function: `iqrm_mask`, that operates on an array that contains a spectral statistic that captures the level of RFI contamination in each frequency channel of a search-mode data block. Here is a basic example on an artificially generated time-frequency data block:


```python
import numpy as np
from iqrm import iqrm_mask

### Generate a time-frequency block containing Gaussian noise
nsamp = 1024
nchan = 10
data = np.random.normal(size=nsamp*nchan).reshape(nsamp, nchan)

# Add simulated RFI to channels indices 5 and 6
data[:, 5] += 5 * np.sin(np.arange(nsamp))
data[:, 6] += 10 * np.sin(np.arange(nsamp))

# Use per-channel standard deviation as contamination measure
spectral_std = data.std(axis=0)

### Run IQRM
mask, votes = iqrm_mask(spectral_std, radius=2)

# 'mask' is a boolean mask where 'True' denotes a channel index deemed to be contaminated
print(np.where(mask)[0])
# Output:
# [5 6]

# 'votes' is a dictionary of sets; see section 2 of the paper for an explanation of the 'voting' system
for caster in sorted(votes.keys()):
    recipients = votes[caster]
    print(caster, recipients)
# Output:
# 3 {5}
# 4 {5, 6}
# 5 {6}
# 7 {5, 6}
# 8 {6}

# For example '7 {5, 6}' means that from the point of view of channel 7, channels 5 and 6 have an abnormally high level of RFI contamination.
```
