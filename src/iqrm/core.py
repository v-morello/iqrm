    Compute the IQRM mask for one-dimensional input data x.
    The input 'x' is expected to represent a per-channel statistic that measures RFI contamination
    in a block of time-frequency data. Any statistic can be used, but an important requirement is
    that larger values must indicate higher levels of RFI contamination.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : list or ndarray
        Input data (1-dimensional)
    radius : int, optional
        Radius in number of elements. If a float is passed, it is truncated. A recommended value
        is 10% of the number of frequency channels
    threshold : float, optional
        Flagging threshold in number of Gaussian sigmas
    ignorechans: list or ndarray
        Channels which are known to be bad already

    Returns
    -------
    mask : ndarray
        Boolean mask with the same size as the input 'x', where 'True' denotes an outlier
    votes_cast : dict of sets
        Dictionary of sets, where the keys are input array indices i that cast at least one vote,
        and the values are the set of array indices that received a vote from i.
